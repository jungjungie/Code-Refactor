# Code-Refactor

This exercise included a set of pre-constructed html and css files.  I was tasked with taking the existing code and refactoring it so that:
 - It follows accessibility standards;
 - The website is optimized for search engines. 

Additionally, I went through and consolidated the code where I could. From the user's perspective, the website will visually look the same from before and after I edited the code. However, the finished files will display code that is more efficient and easier/cleaner to read.

### HTML Semantics Applied:

 - Added a more descriptive &lt;title&gt; in the &lt;head&gt;
 - Replaced all &lt;div&gt; tags with more specific semantic HTML elements, with the exception of the &lt;div&gt; containing the hero image
 - Added alt attribute to images
 - Nested all images within a &lt;figure&gt; tag
