# Code-Refactor

This task included a set of pre-constructed html and css files.  I was tasked with taking the existing code and refactoring it so that:
- it follows current accessibility standards, and
- so that the website is optimized for search engines. 

Additionally, I went through and consolidated the code where I could. From the user's perspective, the website will visually look the same from before and after I edited the code. However, the finished files will display code that is more efficient and easier/cleaner to read.


Semantics Added:
- Added a more descriptive <title> in the <head>
- Replaced all <div> tags with more specific semantic HTML elements, with the exception of the <div> tag containing the hero image
- Added alt attribute to images
- Nested all images within a <figure> tag
